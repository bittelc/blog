Twelve years ago, I graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in mechanical engineering. I was a good student in university, with something like arrogance driving me to get good grades and show prestige. But the truth of that degree is that I wasn't excited by the profession. The idea of excelling in school drove me much more than the idea of being an excellent mechanical engineer in the years that followed.

In the last year of this degree, I leaned into the honesty of that reality and decided to drop the idea of getting a job in mechanical engineering. I attended classes less and less, skipping my capstone thermal dynamics meetings. And instead, I was living my life within khanacademy.com and code.org learning how to do for loops and if statements, creating chess boards in Excel, and sending programmatic requests to APIs.

In retrospect, it should have been one of the scariest moments of my schooling- dropping all of the investment I (and my parents) had made in my education in favor of prerecorded online tutorials and creating trivial applications. But of course it wasn't that way. Like most others who eventually lean into programming as a career, the first discovery of a "hello world" program are beyond words. The "WOW" factor that few moments in life can rival. To see "hello world" printed on stdio, to say "I built a thing" was like being god of transistors. I wasn't thinking about money or power or career or potential. It was pure joy of creation. The joy of making things behave that are unimaginably small and moving extremely fast.

No career achievement has ever met this joy. I've become mid levels, senior, lead, manager; worked on wonderfully exciting products, built reliable, beautiful software that I was truly and deeply proud of, with people that I respect and care for. But none of that has ever touched that thrill of seeing "hello world" printed at on that terminal line in Eaton Hall computer lab on that night in 2014.

But a few days ago, something came close.

I sent the word `this` to a program, and it returned 1024 numbers that it believes best semantically represent the word `this`:

This is a miracle.

This is truly a miracle.

And for a brief moment, my heart and soul were in touch with the absolute brilliance of humanity's genius when I saw these numbers.

To convert a word, a sentence, a document, into a set of numbers which capture *the meaning* of it requires mind-boggling mathematics. I live in a world that has 3 dimensions- width, depth, height. To enable a computer to understand the word "this" in all the ways humans use it, the computer uses 1024 dimensions. It puts those numbers within a graph that has 1024 axes (plural of axis is axes? crazy). Within this graph, it places other words with 1024 dimensions. Once enough words live in that graph, it can search this incredibly complicated graph to find nearby words which eventually allow it to write like we, as humans, do.

How many thousands of years of mathematical progress are contained within the output on my screen?

There is much to be said about the direction of AI in a late-stage capitalistic society like ours. In future writing, I will not shy away from criticizing it's position within the economy, and those poised to make immense amounts of money at potentially tremendous cost.

But today, AI has brought me a gift- a reminder that I am a software engineer because of what happened that day at Eaton Hall when my computer said hello world and I felt my love for humanity expand.
