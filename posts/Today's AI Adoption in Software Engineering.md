Six months ago, I started getting the feeling that I was being left behind in software engineering by the YouTubers and bloggers out there describing their massive successes in being able to instruct an AI to build an entire application from scratch using just chat-based instructions. That fear caused me to spend significant energy in trying to understand the landscape and how quickly I'd need to find a different profession. LinkedIn didn't help. I would sign on more and more often, and see every day that my feed was filled with software engineers who had stopped writing code and now just review the agent's PR.

As a result, I invested heavily into building with AI. I used to absolutely love software engineering, and so my fear of losing that as a profession was something very scary to me. That investment has yielded tremendous results. Three months ago, I had successfully moved to building with AI into building for AI. Today, nearly every line of code I write is reviewed or written entirely by an agent. (Side note, this blog entry is a contrast to that, as I have written every word myself)

But along this journey, I also realized that I was completely misguided in my understanding of the adoption of AI within software engineering. While LinkedIn fed me success stories, it wasn't feeding me the internal conversations engineers were having in their own heads about skepticism, hesitancy, lack of time to play with it, experiences where AI showed its inadequacy, etc. Instead, I was seeing the extremely bloated market space fed by those who have had success or are dependent on AI for profit.

I've spoken with a few dozen software engineers of varying experience levels. Very few are using AI in a way that significantly alters their productivity. Most software engineers have experienced some nice benefits with ChatGPT in its ability to teach them how code works, or about syntactic meaning, usually by copying code out of their text editor and pasting into ChatGPT directly and asking a question about it. Most have also had some minor encounters (with varying success) with GitHub's Copilot in reviewing PRs or asking it questions. Some have dabbled with Cursor or VS Code's integration with Claude, but most have not made full switches to relying on these tools. Few have not yet used ChatGPT or Copilot.

This post is aimed at bringing some peace and a reality check to those who might be feeling fearful or unclear about the current state of AI adoption within software engineering. If you haven't yet had significant gains from it, that's completely normal. You're in the majority. But it's also an absolutely wonderful day to begin leaning into it more heavily, as the companies aimed at onboarding you are doing a beautiful job at making it easy for you to play with it in a low-stakes, easy-to-pickup way!
